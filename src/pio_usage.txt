*PIO state resource usage

** SPI 

This is a very small program with only 3 intructions
It runs on PIO0, but if memory (there is only space for 32 instructions on each PIO), it might need to be moved to PIO1

** DMD Reader and DMD Frame detection

With the existing code, WPC, Whitestar and Spike1 still use less than 29 instructions for both frame detection and 
reading of data. Therefore, they use the same PIO0
